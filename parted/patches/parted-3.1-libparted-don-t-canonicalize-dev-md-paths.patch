Subject: [PATCH] libparted: don't canonicalize /dev/md/ paths (#872361)

This is the same issue we have with /dev/mapper/ paths that was fixed in
commit c1eb485b9fd8919e18f192d678bc52b0488e6ee0. When libparted
is used to setup the device the symlink should be used to reference it,
not the backing device name which could change.

* libparted/device.c (ped_device_get): Don't canonicalize names
  that start with "/dev/md/".
