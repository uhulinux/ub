+A small number of configuration options can be controlled by editing the

+
+    <USER-CONFIG-DIR>/virt-viewer/settings
+
+This file is a text file in INI format, with application options in the
+[virt-viewer] group and per-guest options in a group identified by the guest's
+UUID. The application options should not be edited manually. There is also a
+special [fallback] group which specifies options for all guests that don't have
+an explicit group.
+
+For each guest, the initial fullscreen monitor configuration can be specified
+by using the B<monitor-mapping> key. This configuration only takes effect when
+the -f/--full-screen option is specified.
+
+The value of this key is a list of mappings between a guest display and a
+client monitor. Each mapping is separated by a semicolon character, and the
+mappings have the format <GUEST-DISPLAY-ID>:<CLIENT-MONITOR-ID>.
+
+For example, to map guest displays 1 and 2 to client monitors 2 and 3 for the
+guest with a UUID of e4591275-d9d3-4a44-a18b-ef2fbc8ac3e2, use:
